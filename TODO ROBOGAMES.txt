March 27 2025:

- Fixed the Arduino-launch_robot.launch.py issue (ROS controller activation) => removed delay in Arduino code. 
- Got Servo Motors (only) to move using Xbox controller Joystick

Todo:
	- Implement movement in motors using Arduino code
	- Make diff drive Arduino communicate with cmd_vel topic to move robot on rviz
	- Implement buttons using joystick.yaml so it runs in rviz
	- Fix motor controller issue (wiring is wrong -> capacitor circuit output gives no voltage)
	
ROS side:
- Behavior tree 
- Camera code integration
- Ensure SLAM MAPPING stays consistent

Extra:
- Buy Ribbon cable to ensure Lidar works

Arduino Code:
- Test motors forward backward with Xbox controller after fixing motor controller issues
- Add loop feedback with GPS and IMU 
- Differential Drive
